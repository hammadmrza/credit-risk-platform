# Credit Risk & Fraud Detection Platform

![Process Flow](Credit_Risk_Platform_Process_Flow.png)

> An end-to-end credit risk decisioning platform that integrates PD/LGD/EAD
> modelling, fraud detection, explainability, and regulatory analytics into a
> unified workflow. Trained on real-world LendingClub + FICO HELOC data.

## What this is

A credit risk **decisioning system** — not a single model. The platform ingests
a loan application, runs it through a hierarchical decision engine (fraud gate
→ hard policy → credit model → refer band → approve), and produces a fully
explained decision with all the regulatory artifacts a Canadian non-bank lender
would need to document it: SHAP-based adverse reasons, counterfactual recourse
paths, IFRS 9 ECL provision, Basel III RWA, risk-based price, and an LLM-drafted
credit memo.

Most portfolio projects build a single XGBoost model and call it done. This
project reproduces how real lenders actually decide — integrated credit + fraud
+ policy + explainability + compliance in one coherent system.

## The v1.1 story — why segmentation matters

The v1.0 unified model reports combined OOT AUC of ~0.68, which at first glance
looks weak. The underlying cause is architectural, not modelling: when two
product books (unsecured LendingClub + secured HELOC) are trained into one
XGBoost, `loan_term_months` becomes a product-type proxy (36/60-month unsecured
vs imputed-36 HELOC) and absorbs signal that belongs to real credit features.

The v1.1 challenger architecture (`src/models/pd_model_segmented.py` +
`notebooks/phase4b/`) trains separate PD models per product and excludes the
proxy features. Expected OOT lift: Unsecured ~0.72, Secured ~0.76 — both
deployment-grade.

The v1.0 unified model remains champion for **cross-product decisioning**
because:
1. HELOC thin-data overfitting risk (10K rows vs 2.2M unsecured)
2. 2× operational overhead (two model cards, monitoring pipelines, OSFI
   governance documents)
3. Cross-product score incomparability — important for portfolio-level capital
   allocation and concentration limits

The segmented models are used for **per-product monitoring, challenger
validation, and thin-file performance analysis**. Both are shown side-by-side
in Tab 3, Section 3.

This is documented in [`MODEL_CARD.md`](MODEL_CARD.md) and disclosed in the
Streamlit app itself — in line with OSFI E-23 expectations for model risk
management.

## What makes this different from a typical portfolio project

1. **Hierarchical decision engine.** Fraud → policy → credit → refer → approve.
   Policy failures route to the right adverse-action letter reason (not SHAP),
   fraud declines never expose the fraud reason to the applicant (FCAC
   compliance).

2. **Calibration-first validation.** Tab 3 leads with Brier score, calibration
   gap, and per-product segment calibration — because for IFRS 9 and Basel
   capital, well-calibrated 0.72 AUC beats miscalibrated 0.80 AUC.

3. **Regulatory grounding.** Basel III IRB formula shown in full (not just the
   number), IFRS 9 origination-PD proxy explicitly disclosed, Criminal Code
   s.347 35% APR cap enforced visibly in pricing, Stage 1/2/3 coverage bands
   colour-coded against industry benchmarks.

4. **Honest disclosure as a feature.** Every synthetic proxy, every simplifying
   assumption, every known limitation is surfaced in yellow callout boxes inside
   the app itself. A reviewer sees the limitations before they need to ask.

5. **Product-proxy detection.** The `loan_term_months` issue was found during
   validation and documented in MODEL_CARD §6. The v1.1 segmented models
   demonstrate the fix. This is the kind of finding OSFI E-23 validators look for.

## Scope and what this platform is NOT

This is a portfolio-quality demonstration of commercial credit-risk methodology.
It is **not**:

- A production credit risk system (no LOS integration, no real-time credit
  bureau feed, no SOC 2 audit)
- A substitute for formal OSFI E-23 model validation (use the MODEL_CARD as
  a starting framework, not the endpoint)
- A compliance opinion on ECOA, Reg B, or FCAC requirements (consult counsel)
- A recommendation engine for actual lending decisions

It **is** a credible demonstration that I understand how a real credit risk
decisioning system is architected, validated, disclosed, and governed.
